Assignment 03: SOAP Web Services

Name: Getachew Demissie Abebe

I have done both server and client by by myself

The server is deployed on heroku and its url is => https://ancient-atoll-4298.herokuapp.com/soap/people?wsdl

To execute the Client,first clone the repositery to your local machine, then run ant install, 
and run ant execute.client. And, finally press enter to see all the outputs.

The log file is attached in the server repository.
